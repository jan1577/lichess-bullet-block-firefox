A Firefox Extension to remove Bullet Games from lichess.org. Optionally remove Blitz Games and Puzzle Variants.

Bullet Games are addictive - this Firefox extension removes all options to launch a Bullet Game on lichess, stopping
you from wasting your time by chasing the next dopamine push. 

## Setup
The extension has not been signed by Firefox yet. At the moment, you can add it to Firefox Developer Edition or Firefox Nightly by uploading it as a zip folder.Follow the steps below:

First, you have to allow the installation of unsigned extension by following the following steps
- go to about:config
- set xpinstall.signatures.required to false

- Clone the repository and zip the files or download is as a zip-folder
- go to about:addons
- click on the settings symbol and select "Install Add-on From File"
- select the ffolder and confirm you want to install the unsigned extension

If the extension does not work right away, you may have to allow the extension to always access lichess.org instead of "Only when clicked".

## Options
The extension has an options page where you can configure the settings. Go to about:addons to set your preferences.
